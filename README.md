# PIXLSUS
This is the repository for being able to write posts for https://pixls.us and to preview the results against the site style.

## How To
Articles are held in their own sub-folders.  For example, this particular repository has a single article located in the folder `Sample`.  Inside this folder is the markdown file for the article, `index.md`, as well as an optional stylesheet for the page `index.css`.  New articles should be created in a sub-folder in a similar fashion, and all assets should be self-contained in that folder.

1. Simply fork this repository to your own account.
2. Each post will be held in a sub-folder.
