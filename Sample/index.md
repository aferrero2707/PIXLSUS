This is what a markdown file will look like for [PIXLS.US](https://pixls.us).
If you're just starting out, I recommend that you simply copy this file into your own sub-folder for your article and modify it as needed.



## Front Matter
At the top of this markdown file is some "front-matter" contained between a triplet of dashes.  This is the metadata for your post.
